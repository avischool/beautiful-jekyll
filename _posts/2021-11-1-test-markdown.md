[Effects of COVID-19 on College Studentsâ€™ Mental Health in the United States: Interview Survey Study](https://www.jmir.org/2020/9/e21279/)

1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?

Null &rarr; The mental health of college students is not affected by COVID-19\
Alternative &rarr; The mental health of college students is affect by COVID-19

2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?

Participants were interviewed by 20 undergraduate researched "trained in qualitative methods and the use of the interview survey guide"
The authors did not conduct the interviews. In addition, interviewees had to fill out a survey prior to their interview.

There were also several coders involved. First, a single coder trained in qualitative analysis methods, analyzed the interview transcripts and found themes in the results. Coder 1 then discussed with two other codes to find discrepancies in the data.

3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?

All references are linked, however many references and datasets are not available on the external websites, and one needs to pay to access the data. However, the data collected by the researchers is all public, are all tables, figures are shown on the website.

4. Why are they interested in this data?

The researchers want to prove their alternative hypothesis so they can provide helpful resources to college students struggling with their mental health during COVID.

The study recognizes that poor mental health is the number one barrier to academic success in students and aims to understand how covid has impacted the mental health of college students. The study aims to understand what aspects of COVID most impact students, and to "highlight the urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address the mental health of college students."

5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?

Several types of data are being recorded.

- The demographics of each participant
- PSS Scores (Perceived Stress Scale)
- Asked if stress and anxiety increased, decreased, or remained the same because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Asked about specific pandemic-related stressors (12 academic-, health-, and lifestyle-related categories of outcomes)
- Guided to describe stressors, coping strategies, and barriers to mental health treatment during a typical semester without associating with the COVID-19 pandemic.

6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?

They published their data through a variety of different types of graphs and tables. They showed the categories and themes of COVID-19 stressors as previously discussed and published quotes from interviewees, ensuring participants remained anonymous. They then explained each stressors, and gave the specific percentages of participants affected by those stressors. In the end they proved that college students were affected by COVID-19.

7. How was this study funded?

The study was partly funded by a Texas A&M University President's Excellence (X-grant) award.

8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

I don't think so. For a relatively simple premise, the study's researchers went incredibly in depth to come to a conclusion that many may have assumed. The study doesn't seem rushed in any way, and their methods and the design of the study seems to have addressed a large amount of data points regarding COVID-19 and mental health. COVID-19 is also an ongoing issue, so most likely the researchers of this study believe they could contribute to something that is currently impacting every person's mental health. In other words, the study, written only three months after the start of the pandemic, seems like a response to crisis rather than just another study to keep a researcher relevant.

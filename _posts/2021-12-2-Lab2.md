## Question 1

#### Discuss how you used the API to obtain the dataset.



```python
import requests

BASE_URL = "https://hm-cs.herokuapp.com"
ENDPOINT = "/socks"
API_KEY = "ArtOfDataKEY123"

payload = {'key': API_KEY,'idx':0}
response = requests.get(BASE_URL+ENDPOINT, params=payload)
rows=[]
print(response.text)
i = 1
while response.ok:

    payload = {'key': API_KEY,'idx':i}
    response = requests.get(BASE_URL+ENDPOINT, params=payload)
    print(response.text)
    i += 1

```

In order to find the csv file, we need to call our api on an index that increases over and over. In other words, we want out index to start at 0, and as long as our index is in range, and as long as there are no other errors, we want to call out api over and over as our index increases.

I defined three variables, the base url, the endpoint, and the API key. The API key is part of my payload, and we are essentially combining the base url and the endpint. We call the api from index 0, just so that we have an initial response, then we call the API starting from index 1 and increasing the index by 1 after each call. By the end, the code returns the text of each row for as many rows as there are before we get an "index out of range" error.

We then take our results and store it in a csv.

## Question 2


#### Which sock has the most variations? If there is more than one answer, then list all of them.

```python
def variety_function():
    mostvariety = []
    varsdict = {}
    for row in data:
        variation = row['Name']
        if variation not in varsdict:
            varsdict[variation] = 0
        varsdict[variation] += 1



    ogmax = max(varsdict,key=varsdict.get)
    ogmax = varsdict[ogmax]
    while varsdict[max(varsdict,key=varsdict.get)] == ogmax:
        currentmax = max(varsdict,key=varsdict.get)
        mostvariety.append(currentmax)
        del varsdict[currentmax]

    return mostvariety

```


##### Results



```python

['argyle crew socks', 'color-blocked socks', 'frilly knee-high socks', 'holey tights', 'kiddie socks', 'mixed-tweed socks', 'no-show socks', 'semi-opaque socks', 'semi-opaque tights', 'sequin leggings', 'simple-accent socks', 'striped socks', 'striped tights', 'tube socks', 'ultra no-show socks', 'vivid leggings', 'vivid socks', 'vivid tights']

```

I knew I wanted my table to have each sock variety and the number of socks with that variety, so the first for loop accomplishes that by creating a new key if the specific variation does not yet exist in my dictionary, and then adding 1 no matter what to that variation.

max() only returns one key, so I set that key to ogmax. I then get the value of that key. In this case ogmax is 8. The while loop basically says, "While there are more keys with 8 pairs of socks, keep adding them to a separate list then delete them from our original list." At some point `varsdict[max(varsdict, key=varsdict.get)]` will no longer be 8.

## Question 3


#### How many socks of each color are there? If a sock has two different colors, it should be counted in both. However, if a sock has the same Color1 and Color2, make sure you donâ€™t double count it!

```python
def color_function():
    all_colors = []
    for row in data:
        firstcolor = row["Color 1"]
        secondcolor = row["Color 2"]
        all_colors.append(firstcolor)
        all_colors.append(secondcolor)

    for row in data:
        firstcolor = row["Color 1"]
        secondcolor = row["Color 2"]
        if firstcolor == secondcolor:
            all_colors.remove(firstcolor)


    varsdict = {}
    for i in all_colors:
        if i not in varsdict:
            varsdict[i] = 0
        varsdict[i] += 1
    return varsdict,len(all_colors)

```

##### Results



```python
({'Colorful': 14, 'Light blue': 33, 'Beige': 15, 'White': 85, 'Gray': 31, 'Black': 59, 'Pink': 41, 'Yellow': 33, 'Red': 39, 'Green': 50, 'Blue': 47, 'Purple': 37, 'Orange': 27, 'Brown': 11}, 522)
```

My strategy for this question was to collect all the colors, regardless if a sock had two of the same colors. Once I had a list of all the colors, I iterated through the list again, this time taking note of if a row had two of the same colors. Everytime that was true, I would take the color, and delete one value with that color from the list. So if a row had "Beige" as Color 1 and Color 2, I would delete "Beige" from the list

## Question 1

### Finding the average speed of all Digimon

```python
def averagespeed():
    with open("digimon.csv", "r") as f:
        data = csv.DictReader(f)
        total = 0
        digimon_count = 0
        for pokemon in data:
            total += float(pokemon['Spd'])
            digimon_count+=1
    return total/digimon_count
```

We encountered something similar to this question with the penguin.csv exercise, so I knew that we had to iterate through the list of dictionaries, sum up all the speed values, and divide that by the total number of digimon.

While I did not allow this function to be universal for any attribute of a digimon, I could do so by making the attribute in question a paremeter of the function.

## Question 2

### Identify the number of Digimon with a specic attribute

```python
def getcount(column_name,specific_trait):
    with open("digimon.csv", "r") as f:
        data = csv.DictReader(f)
        finaldict = {}
        for pokemon in data:
            attribute = pokemon[column_name]
            if attribute not in finaldict:
                finaldict[attribute] = 0
            finaldict[attribute] += 1
    return finaldict[specific_trait]
```

We are taking in two parameters in this function. The column name, such as "Type", as well as the specific characteristic that we are trying to identify, such as "Vaccine." So we are extracting the specific characteristic for each row, and if that characteristic is not yet a key in our dictionary, we add it, and increase the number of times is shows up by 1. By the end, we have a table that looks like this:

|         | # of occurences |
| :------ | :-------------- |
| Vaccine | 10              |
| Free    | 12              |
| Data    | 15              |
| Virus   | 35              |

We then return the row of this table with the same name as our second parameter.

## Question 3

### Find three digimon that have a memory of less than 15 and an Attack greater than 300

```python
def bestteam():
    with open("digimon.csv", "r") as f:
        data = list(csv.DictReader(f))
        listofteams = []
        for a in range(0,len(data)):
            for b in range(a,len(data)):
                for c in range(b,len(data)):
                    totalatk = float(data[a]['Atk'])+float(data[b]['Atk'])+float(data[c]['Atk'])
                    totalmemory = float(data[a]['Memory'])+float(data[b]['Memory'])+float(data[c]['Memory'])
                    if totalatk >= 300 and  totalmemory<= 15:
                        specific_team = [data[a]['Digimon'],data[b]['Digimon'],data[c]['Digimon']]
                    else:
                        continue
                    if len(specific_team) == len(set(specific_team)):
                        listofteams.append(specific_team)
    return listofteams
```

We are taking in two parameters in this function. The column name, such as "Type", as well as the specific characteristic that we are trying to identify, such as "Vaccine." So we are extracting the specific characteristic for each row, and if that characteristic is not yet a key in our dictionary, we add it, and increase the number of times is shows up by 1. By the end, we have a table that looks like this:

|         | # of occurences |
| :------ | :-------------- |
| Vaccine | 10              |
| Free    | 12              |
| Data    | 15              |
| Virus   | 35              |

We then return the row of this table with the same name as our second parameter.

## Question 1

### Finding the average speed of all Digimon

```python
def averagespeed():
    with open("digimon.csv", "r") as f:
        data = csv.DictReader(f)
        total = 0
        digimon_count = 0
        for pokemon in data:
            total += float(pokemon['Spd'])
            digimon_count+=1
    return total/digimon_count
```

We encountered something similar to this question with the penguin.csv exercise, so I knew that we had to iterate through the list of dictionaries, sum up all the speed values, and divide that by the total number of digimon.

While I did not allow this function to be universal for any attribute of a digimon, I could do so by making the attribute in question a paremeter of the function.

      <h1>
        How postive are the characters in the Office? Using Sentiment Analysis
        to analyze the story of a paper company.
      </h1>

      <p>
        I've tried to introduce a lot of people to the office. From what I can
        tell, others see the show as boring, mundane, and dull. I...just looked
        up synonyms of boring so that this would take up more space. But I will
        prove, that even though the show is not too positive nor negative, the
        show is still funny. Not really, I'm just gonna prove the show is not
        too positive or negative.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was looking back on this, and didn't think I had enough
        visualizations, even though I made a bunch of word clouds with altair,
        so here's another one, just because.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can learn quite a bit about the characters in the office just by
        looking at the words they use most. We first have to clean the data we
        have, removing special characters, symbols, numbers, and stop words.
        Then we can filter the data for a certain characters, let's take Dwight
        for example, and find the counts of the word he uses most. We can then
        use altair to create a word cloud of those words. Here are the word
        clouds for three different characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's easy to see who's who. Jim's always talking about Dwight, Dwight's
        talking about Michael, and Michael thinks he knows everything. A word
        cloud of the most common words each character uses helps us understand
        them and who they are.

        The second part of this analysis is finding out how positive or negative
        the office is, and because we learned ways to statistically analyze
        data, I'll use the carefully written notes I took to do just that. We'll
        start by gathering sample tweets, which have already been classified as
        positive and negative, and use that to train our model. The Naives Bayes
        classifier is a collection of algorithms for classifying data, and in
        our case, we train these algorithms to understand whether certain
        expressions are positive or negative.
      </p>

      <p>
        Classifying data with NLP takes time, which means I can't determine
        whether each line of the office is positive or negative. Believe me, I
        tried.
      </p>

      <img
        src="https://i.ibb.co/9g78KLs/15973-C85-915-C-4-C6-E-9521-12-DA2789-C2-A4.jpg"
        class="image3"
      />

      <p>
        Instead, I'm gonna have to use what Mr. Lee taught me. I decided to take
        samples of 10, and find their positivity rate (positive lines divided by
        total lines). I'm going to take 50 of those samples, and bootstrap those
        50 postivity rates to get the best possible mean for the dataset as a
        whole. There are around 58721 lines in the office, which means there are
        1.34 * 10^41 different ways to get 10 lines. We only have 50.
      </p>

      <p>
        After bootstrapping sub-samples of 10 from our sample of 50, with
        replacement, I did this 20 times. To be completely honest with you, I
        came to Boston for the long weekend, and on the car ride I just thought
        of random numbers for this stuff. Here is a list of all the calculated
        sample averages:
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://i.ibb.co/rkNzFHB/Screen-Shot-2022-05-29-at-1-27-51-PM.png"
        border="0"
      />
      <p>
        Anyway, with our 20 different averges, I found the 35% and 65%
        percentiles, which should give us a 30% confidence interval. Again,
        random number. So with 30% confidence, we can say out number is in
        between 0.4765 and 0.5235. So, to conclude, we aren't so confident that
        about 50% of all the lines in the office are positive, and 50% are
        negative.
      </p>

        This all seems stupid, and it is, but it's fascinating to see how
        successful of a show the office is, since it's just a bunch of people
        working in a paper company. But maybe the office is watched by so many
        because it doesn't try so hard to be something, it doesn't try to make
        people happy or angry or sad or excited. The office is relatable, unless
        you are a junior at HM, I would say real life is just neutral. If you
        are junior at HM, it doesn't matter how much bootstrapping you do, your
        still depressed. But the office isn't boring, it's real, it's authentic,
        and the 50% positivity rating is why it's such a great show.
